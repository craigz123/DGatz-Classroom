				<h1>About Me</h1>

      			<a href="index.html"><img src="assets/images/CraigZ.jpg"  alt="Responsive image"></a>

      			<p>I was a lifelong food service operator who was looking to make a change.  After doing a large amount of research and just wanting to shake things up, I decided that software development as anew career path made a lot of sense.</p>

      			<p>I've found the learning process challenging yet rewarding. In my past experiences, I was able to draw on things that I had learned before to create parallels for new learning. I found that I had to adjust my style to conform with the sheer amount of new material.</p>

      			<p>With that said, I have reached the end of the boot camp, but I'm just the beginning of of this new adventure.</p>
